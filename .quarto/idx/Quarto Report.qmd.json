It examines various metrics such as literacy rates, school enrollment numbers and levels of educational attainment for a better insight into the intricate dynamics that shape global education.\n\nThis analysis offers profound insights into socio-economic and policy environments that influence educational landscapes worldwide. It is a comprehensive guide for policy makers, academic institutions, and international organizations with an aim of making informed decisions that can improve education opportunities and quality for different populations across continents.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary aim of this report is to:\n\n- **Identify** key trends in education globally.\n- **Analyze** disparities in educational outcomes across different geographical regions.\n- **Explore** the relationships between educational levels, economic conditions, and life expectancy.\n\n\n## Methodology\nOur methodology encompasses:\n\n- **Mapping** global educational data to visually represent geographical disparities.\n- **Comparative analysis** by continent to highlight differences and similarities in educational outcomes.\n- **Time series analysis** to trace the evolution of education over recent years.\n- **Statistical modeling** to examine the correlations between education, GDP, and life expectancy.\n\n---\n\n# Analysis of Global Educational Disparities\n\n## Educational Proficiency Across Continents\n\nOur analysis highlights significant disparities in educational outcomes across different continents, with a particular focus on the proficiency levels in reading at the end of lower secondary education. The visualization below illustrates that many countries in ***Africa*** have the lowest percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading, starkly contrasting with countries in ***Europe***, ***Asia***, and ***North America***, where a relatively high percentage of students meet or exceed this educational threshold.\n\nThis disparity points to systemic issues that may include but are not limited to, **resource allocation**, **educational policies**, and **socio-economic** factors that impact educational systems across the globe.\n\n```{r world map plot, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 15}\n#| fig-align: center\nworld_map <- map_data(\"world\")\nmap_data <- merge(world_map, combined_data, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"country\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n# plot\nggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value)) +\n  geom_polygon(color = NA) +  # Remove borders by setting color = NA\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"red\", mid = \"lightgreen\", high = \"green\", \n                       midpoint = median(map_data$obs_value, na.rm = TRUE), \n                       na.value = \"grey\",  \n                       name = \"Obs Value\") +\n  labs(title = \"Education World Map\",  \n       fill = \"Observation Value\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  \n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),  \n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),  \n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),  \n    axis.title.y = element_blank()   \n  )\n\n\n```\n\n\n## Trends of Educational Outcomes \n### Regional Comparison\n<div style= \"float:right;position: relative; top: 5px;\">\n```{r bar-chart, echo=FALSE}\n\nggplot(continent_summary, aes(x = continent, y = average_obs, fill = continent)) +\n  geom_col() +  # Create columns\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"slategray\", \"darkslategray\", \"lightblue4\", \"steelblue\", \"cadetblue\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Educational Disparity by Continent in 2018\",\n    subtitle = \"Visualizing average observation values across continents\",\n    x = \"Continent\",\n    y = \"Average Observation Value\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray20\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray20\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n```\n</div>\n\n\nThis bar chart provides a clear visualization of the disparities in educational outcomes across different continents as of the latest data point. The chart highlights the variance in educational achievements, which can be attributed to a multitude of socio-economic factors unique to each continent. Notice the stark differences between continents such as ***Africa*** compared to ***North America*** and ***Asia***.\n\n### Time Series Analysis: Educational Trends by Continent\n\nVaried trends in educational outcomes across continents have been revealed by the time series graph provided below, indicating significant disparities in transition rates from primary to secondary and tertiary education. Notably, no significant improvement or a slight decline in educational outcomes has been experienced in **Africa** and **Europe**. This is largely attributed to **limited household incomes**, which directly impact children’s access to educational opportunities. Additionally, efforts to create equal access to quality education across these regions are hampered by **inadequate government investment** in education infrastructure.\n\nIn contrast, a positive trend has been shown in **the Americas**, where educational outcomes are on the rise. This improvement suggests that more effective educational policies and investments have been implemented compared to other regions. However, the **southern regions** of asia have faced a deline. This decline highlights critical vulnerabilities in the region's educational framework, including economic instabilities and uneven distribution of educational resources, which necessitate urgent attention and strategic policy interventions to reverse the negative trends.\n\n```{r time series, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 20}\nggplot(data = continent_data, aes(x = year, y = average_obs, color = continent, group = continent)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  # Line size slightly thicker for visibility\n  labs(title = \"Educational Trends by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Annual changes in average education values from 2015 to 2018\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Education Observation Value\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  # Custom color palette to match other charts\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +  # Consistent font family as other visuals\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),  # Light grey background\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),  # Slightly different shade for the panel\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n```\n\n\n## Correlation Analysis: Education, GDP, and Life Expectancy\n\n<div style= \"float:right;position: relative; top: 5px;\">\n```{r obs and gdp, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US.., y = obs_value, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 3) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  \n  labs(title = \"Observation Value vs GDP by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing correlations between GDP and education outcomes\",\n       x = \"GDP (constant 2015 US$)\",\n       y = \"Observation Value\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray20\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray20\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, \"cm\")\n    )  \n\n```\n</div>\n```{r gdp and life_exp, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US.., y = Life.expectancy.at.birth..total..years., color = continent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 3) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  \n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs GDP by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing correlations between GDP and Life Expectancy\",\n       x = \"GDP (constant 2015 US$)\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray20\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray20\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, \"cm\")  \n  )\n```\n\n\nNumerous studies have indicated a **positive link** between **education** and **GDP**, as well as between **GDP** and **life expectancy**. Such correlations reiterate the weight of education levels attained and economic performance on national health and life expectancies. It has been observed that increased education leads to better economic outcomes, which subsequently result in improved life quality standards and longer-living populations.\n\nAnother important way in which education affects the level of **income**, is by determining who gets what part of the resources. This is influenced through direct financial benefits such as salary increments or promotions, but also through social gains like higher productivity rates and more invention. When considering health factors, there has been a positive trend among some countries where income levels rise with educational attainment. Consequently, regions with higher GDP per capita have experienced increased longevity due to healthy living resulting from better educational systems.\n\nThis can also be seen in economies that place high premium on education. In this regard, economies experiencing higher GDP growth tend to have better healthcare services leading to improved living conditions as well as public health outcomes (World Bank). Scatter charts show that regions that invest more in schooling not only enjoy increased GDP figures but also longest average lifespan.\n\n\n\n# Conclusion and Recommendations\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report has provided a comprehensive analysis of global educational trends using world maps, bar charts, time series as well as scatter charts among others. According to these visualizations, there are significant differences in education, GDP, and life expectancy on different continents.\n\nThe world map indicated striking regional discrepancies in educational achievements stressing the problems faced by **Africa** and some parts of southern **Asia**. On the other hand, the bar chart showed notable disparities among continents where regions such as **Africa**, *Europe*, *the Americas* or *Asia* seemed to have experienced challenges or improvements concerning their educational outcomes at different times.\n\nTime series demonstrated static/downturns in Europe & Africa while America witnessed an upturn & Asia suffered massive depreciation particularly in Southern regions. These patterns show how economics interacts with education.\n\nFinally, correlation scatter charts highlighted positive associations amid education rates vis-à-vis GDP together with life span. As well as emphasizing the critical role played by education towards better income and health outcomes at society level; these charts further showed that high prevalence is associated with better living standards.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on findings from this study; hereby suggested recommendations can help tackle the identified challenges while making use of the available opportunities:\n\n- ***Increase Governmental and Private Investment in Education***: Especially where shortcomings are noted in certain regions, to guarantee equal access to education.\n\n- ***Improve Educational Infrastructure***: Better school facilities and resources should be available for better results in education and hence higher growth rates of the economy.\n\n- ***Targeted Implementation of Educational Programs***: For instance, in some cases like Southern Asia, a region that has significant inconsistencies or regressions demand educational initiatives that target specific local communities.\n\n- ***Policy Cohesion between Education and Economic Development***: Policies must encourage the linkages between education and economic development objectives to ensure that enhanced learning is translated into economic and health gains.\n\n- ***Adaptation through Monitoring of Education Strategies***: Continuously monitor educational outcomes while ensuring strategies are effective and responsive to changing socio-economic conditions.\n\nIt is about investing on the future generation. All countries need to invest proactively and strategically in their education systems, so as to promote global economic growth prospects including enhancing public health worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include = FALSE}\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(countrycode)\n# Data sets\ndata_indicators <- read.csv(\"unicef_indicator_1.csv\")\ndata_metadata <- read.csv(\"unicef_metadata.csv\")\n\n\n# Data Transformation\n# Defining the columns needed for this report\nmeta_columns <- c(\"country\", \"year\", \"Population..total\", \"GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US..\", \"Life.expectancy.at.birth..total..years.\")\nindicator_columns <- c(\"country\", \"time_period\", \"indicator\", \"obs_value\", \"sex\")\n\n# Preparing the data\ncleaned_metadata <- data_metadata %>%\n  select(all_of(meta_columns)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(country), !is.na(year), !is.na(Population..total), !is.na(GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US..), !is.na(Life.expectancy.at.birth..total..years.))\n\ncleaned_indicator <- data_indicators %>%\n  select(all_of(indicator_columns)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(country), !is.na(time_period), !is.na(indicator), !is.na(obs_value), !is.na(sex)) %>%\n  rename(year = time_period)\n\n# Joining the data and adding continent column\ncombined_data <- inner_join(cleaned_indicator, cleaned_metadata, by = c(\"country\", \"year\")) %>%\n  filter(!sex %in% c(\"Male\", \"Female\")) %>%\n  mutate(continent = countrycode(country, \"country.name\", \"continent\"))\n\n#data for bar chart\ncontinent_summary <- combined_data %>%\n  filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  group_by(continent) %>%\n  summarize(\n    average_obs = mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE),  \n    count = n(),                                 \n    .groups = 'drop'                             \n  ) %>%\n  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, average_obs))  \n# data for time series\ncontinent_data <- combined_data %>%\n  filter(year >= 2015, year <= 2018) %>%\n  group_by(continent, year) %>%\n  summarize(average_obs = mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n\n\n```\n\n---\n\n# Introduction\nThe ***Educational Disaprity*** report gives an extensive overview of educational systems across different continents, using a wide range of data visualization methods to reveal hidden patterns and disparities in education outcomes.

This decline highlights critical vulnerabilities in the region's educational framework, including economic instabilities and uneven distribution of educational resources, which necessitate urgent attention and strategic policy interventions to reverse the negative trends.\n\n```{r time series, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 20}\nggplot(data = continent_data, aes(x = year, y = average_obs, color = continent, group = continent)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  # Line size slightly thicker for visibility\n  labs(title = \"Educational Trends by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Annual changes in average education values from 2015 to 2018\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Education Observation Value\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  # Custom color palette to match other charts\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +  # Consistent font family as other visuals\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),  # Light grey background\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),  # Slightly different shade for the panel\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n```\n\n\n## Correlation Analysis: Education, GDP, and Life Expectancy\n\n<div style= \"float:right;position: relative; top: 5px;\">\n```{r obs and gdp, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\nggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US.., y = obs_value, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 3) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  \n  labs(title = \"Observation Value vs GDP by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing correlations between GDP and education outcomes\",\n       x = \"GDP (constant 2015 US$)\",\n       y = \"Observation Value\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray20\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray20\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, \"cm\")\n    )  \n\n```\n</div>\n```{r gdp and life_exp, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = GDP.per.capita..constant.2015.US.., y = Life.expectancy.at.birth..total..years., color = continent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 3) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"deepskyblue3\", \"darkorange2\", \"mediumseagreen\", \"orchid3\", \"gold3\")) +  \n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs GDP by Continent\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing correlations between GDP and Life Expectancy\",\n       x = \"GDP (constant 2015 US$)\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14, color = \"gray20\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray20\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = NA),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f8f8f8\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, \"cm\")  \n  )\n```\n\n\nNumerous studies have indicated a **positive link** between **education** and **GDP**, as well as between **GDP** and **life expectancy**. Such correlations reiterate the weight of education levels attained and economic performance on national health and life expectancies. It has been observed that increased education leads to better economic outcomes, which subsequently result in improved life quality standards and longer-living populations.\n\nAnother important way in which education affects the level of **income**, is by determining who gets what part of the resources. This is influenced through direct financial benefits such as salary increments or promotions, but also through social gains like higher productivity rates and more invention. When considering health factors, there has been a positive trend among some countries where income levels rise with educational attainment. Consequently, regions with higher GDP per capita have experienced increased longevity due to healthy living resulting from better educational systems.\n\nThis can also be seen in economies that place high premium on education. In this regard, economies experiencing higher GDP growth tend to have better healthcare services leading to improved living conditions as well as public health outcomes (World Bank). Scatter charts show that regions that invest more in schooling not only enjoy increased GDP figures but also longest average lifespan.\n\n\n\n# Conclusion and Recommendations\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report has provided a comprehensive analysis of global educational trends using world maps, bar charts, time series as well as scatter charts among others. According to these visualizations, there are significant differences in education, GDP, and life expectancy on different continents.\n\nThe world map indicated striking regional discrepancies in educational achievements stressing the problems faced by **Africa** and some parts of southern **Asia**. On the other hand, the bar chart showed notable disparities among continents where regions such as **Africa**, *Europe*, *the Americas* or *Asia* seemed to have experienced challenges or improvements concerning their educational outcomes at different times.\n\nTime series demonstrated static/downturns in Europe & Africa while America witnessed an upturn & Asia suffered massive depreciation particularly in Southern regions. These patterns show how economics interacts with education.\n\nFinally, correlation scatter charts highlighted positive associations amid education rates vis-à-vis GDP together with life span. As well as emphasizing the critical role played by education towards better income and health outcomes at society level; these charts further showed that high prevalence is associated with better living standards.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on findings from this study; hereby suggested recommendations can help tackle the identified challenges while making use of the available opportunities:\n\n- ***Increase Governmental and Private Investment in Education***: Especially where shortcomings are noted in certain regions, to guarantee equal access to education.\n\n- ***Improve Educational Infrastructure***: Better school facilities and resources should be available for better results in education and hence higher growth rates of the economy.\n\n- ***Targeted Implementation of Educational Programs***: For instance, in some cases like Southern Asia, a region that has significant inconsistencies or regressions demand educational initiatives that target specific local communities.\n\n- ***Policy Cohesion between Education and Economic Development***: Policies must encourage the linkages between education and economic development objectives to ensure that enhanced learning is translated into economic and health gains.\n\n- ***Adaptation through Monitoring of Education Strategies***: Continuously monitor educational outcomes while ensuring strategies are effective and responsive to changing socio-economic conditions.\n\nIt is about investing on the future generation. All countries need to invest proactively and strategically in their education systems, so as to promote global economic growth prospects including enhancing public health worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"css":["style.css"],"output-file":"Quarto
